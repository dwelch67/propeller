Derived from blinker04.

P15 is the led, the clk register is read, shifted right 12, then written
to the led.  So basically bit 27 (15+12) of the clk register is written
to the led.  The led changes state every 11 seconds give or take.

so 2^27/11= 12201611

2^27/12000000 = 11.18 seconds.

The propeller chip has an internal 12Mhz RC oscillator, which isnt very
accurate.  This board does not come with an external crystal but one
can be added.  I dont have one.  So the 12Mhz appears to be what we are
using and about all I have to choose from.  I think you can only multiply
the external oscillator, not the internal.  So I cannot get to the 80Mhz
advertised with this setup as bought.
