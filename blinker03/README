Derived from blinker02.  This is a multi-cog example.  They made it
pretty clear about sharing the I/O.

Pin Outputs are the result of OR'ing the output states of the cogs
together.

A. A pin is an input only if no active cog sets it to an output.
B. A pin outputs low only if all active cogs that set it to output
   also set it to low.
C. A pin outputs high if any active cog sets it to an output and
   also sets it high.

Address $1F1 in every cog is the system counter, a free running counter.
cnt is a reserved word that specifies this counter.

Both cogs set pin P15 to be an output, either one of them would make
it an output as direction is orred together.

One cog takes bit 25 of cnt (15+10) and basically writes that bit to
output bit 15.  The other takes bit 22 of cnt (15+7) and writes it to
output bit 15.  Assuming a 50% duty cycle of each bit 25 will be on
longer than bit 22, when bit 25 is on the output pin is on and it doesnt
matter what bit 22 is doing.  when bit 25 of the counter is off then
P15 reflects what bit 22 is doing on or off.  So there is a longer on
period then a period of shorter blinks.  25-22 = 3.  2 to the power 3
is 8.  So there will be 8 state changes for bit 22 when bit 25 is off
4 on and 4 off.  So the led will be on for a long time then four shorter
off periods then on for a long time, repeat...
