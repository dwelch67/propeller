Derived from blinker01.  This is a multi-cog example.  There are ways
to share the same I/O resources (maybe) that I have to still fully
understand.  Instead, only one cog talks to the GPIO to blink the led.
One cog counts to some number then writes one value into a shared ram
location in the hub.  One cog counts to some number and writes a different
value into the same location in the shared ram in the hub.  The led cog
reads that shared location to decide what way to set the led.  This is
all set up initially to blink evenly, but because the time to access
the shared memory has to do with the round robin nature of the hub, etc
there is some randomness to it.  Over time the blink rate might not
be on half the time and off half the time.

The point here was not accuracy but to use more than one cog at a time.
